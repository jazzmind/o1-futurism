Let's keep going with this scenario fore-sighting exercise. Repeat again, but this time we're going to envision that a small group of technology leaders (Musk, Bezos, Zuckerberg, Altman, Ma, Gates and others that emerge over time) amass enough power to attempt to drive global events and shape the world aligned to their visions. They may or may not collaborate at times or work against each other. Existing national borders become less relevant than mega corporate "borders" - defined by employment and consumption, so we might also see larger conflicts between global companies and nations as geography governments try to maintain relevance against corporate nations.
