Write this type of story again, but this time imagine there is a well funded organization working to steer humanity toward the best possible outcome. Consider Isaac Asimov's foundation as a model. Rather than psychohistory, consider the organization has access to powerful AI systems and quantum computing that can model and predict world events and suggest optimization strategies. Also consider how humanity and governments are likely to view such an organization and what that org might need to do to survive.
