Next scenario - this time we are going to consider that there is a massive increase in energy requirements for AI development and natural resource needs for robotics. Consider the impact on the planet from a resource scarcity, pollution and climate perspective. Also consider realistic actions that humanity will do to try to reverse damage and adapt to the new environment. Stay as realistic as possible considering the most widely accepted science when formulating timelines as well as possible solutions. Consider the inter-connected systems at play (social, political, economic, environmental, technological) and how these interconnections might lead to, or thwart, solutions.
