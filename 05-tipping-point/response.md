### **Chapter 4: Resistance and Relapse (2075-2090)**

**Backlash Against Restrictions**

Not all embraced the new direction.

- **Industrial Pushback**: Some corporations relocated operations to countries with lax regulations, creating "pollution havens."
- **Black Market Resources**: Illegal mining and trading of rare earth metals thrived, driven by demand for cheaper electronics and robotics.
- **Technological Divide**: A gap widened between nations adopting sustainable practices and those clinging to old methods for short-term gains.

**Environmental Setbacks**

- **Ecosystem Collapse**: In regions where regulations were ignored, ecosystems reached tipping points, leading to desertification and loss of arable land.
- **Climate Refugees**: Millions were displaced due to extreme weather events and environmental degradation, straining global resources.
- **Pandemics**: Loss of biodiversity and encroachment into wild habitats increased the risk of zoonotic diseases.

**Socio-Political Tensions**
