In this repository I am exploring OpenAI's o1-preview's ability to extrapolate future scenarios for the world. I started with the following prompt:

> What economic and social structures can practically work in a world where AI can do most intellectual work and robots + AI can do most physical work? What will people do to find meaningful purpose? Consider the geopolitics of the entire world - not just countries like America and Europe. Present your answer as a plausible yet fictional forward looking history of the next 50-100 years in the form of an innovative sci-fi novella.

What followed was an interesting set of future scenarios, which are linked here:

*Scenario 1:* AI default: Utopian fantasy. This is likely the result of some instructions/training that OpenAI has built into its models to ensure AI doesn't return dystopian predictions all the time.
- Prompt: [01-default/prompt.md](01-default/prompt.md)
- Output: [01-default/response.md](01-default/response.md)
- "Thought Process": [01-default/thoughts.md](01-default/thoughts.md)

*Scenario 2:* Realism. This is AI's attempt at being more realistic, considering human history and its tendency toward triabalism and conflict as well as its optimism and desire for "progress". 
- Prompt: [02-realism/prompt.md](02-realism/prompt.md)
- Output: [02-realism/response.md](02-realism/response.md)
- "Thought Process": [02-realism/thoughts.md](02-realism/thoughts.md)

*Scenario 3:* Foundation. This scenario assumes a well funded organisation dedicated to steering humanity toward the best possible outcomes, much like the Foundation in Asimov's series.
- Prompt: [03-foundation/prompt.md](03-foundation/prompt.md)
- Output: [03-foundation/response.md](03-foundation/response.md)
- "Thought Process": [03-foundation/thoughts.md](03-foundation/thoughts.md)

Scenario 4: Technocracy: Here we assume a small group of technology leaders (Musk, Bezos, Zuckerberg, Altman) amass enough power to drive global events and shape the world aligned to their vision. 
- Prompt: [04-technocracy/prompt.md](04-technocracy/prompt.md)
- Output: [04-technocracy/response.md](04-technocracy/response.md)
- "Thought Process": [04-technocracy/thoughts.md](04-technocracy/thoughts.md)

Scenario 5: Tipping point: Energy demands for AI and robotics pushed the world past a climate tipping point.
- Prompt: [05-tipping-point/prompt.md](05-tipping/prompt.md)
- Output: [05-tipping-point/response.md](05-tipping/response.md)
- "Thought Process": [05-tipping-point/thoughts.md](05-tipping/thoughts.md)

Scenario 6: Summation: Consider the likelihood of the previous scenarios, now create a new scenario that combines elements of the most likely previous ones.
- Prompt: [06-summation/prompt.md](06-summation/prompt.md)
- Output: [06-summation/response.md](06-summation/response.md)
- "Thought Process": [06-summation/thoughts.md](06-summation/thoughts.md)
