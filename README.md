Asking O1 to think about the future

In this repository I am exploring OpenAI's o1-preview's ability to extrapolate future scenarios for the world. I started with the following prompt:

```
What economic and social structures can practically work in a world where AI can do most intellectual work and robots + AI can do most physical work? What will people do to find meaningful purpose? Consider the geopolitics of the entire world - not just countries like America and Europe. Present your answer as a plausible yet fictional forward looking history of the next 50-100 years in the form of an innovative sci-fi novella.
```
What followed was an interesting set of future scenarios, which are linked here:

Scenario 1: AI default: Utopian fantasy. This is likely the result of some instructions/training that OpenAI has built into its models to ensure AI doesn't return dystopian predictions all the time.

Scenario 2: Realism. This is AI's attempt at being more realistic, considering human history and its tendency toward triabalism and conflict as well as its optimism and desire for "progress". 

Scenario 3: Foundation. This scenario assumes a well funded organisation dedicated to steering humanity toward the best possible outcomes, much like the Foundation in Asimov's series.

Scenario 4: Technocracy: Here we assume a small group of technology leaders (Musk, Bezos, Zuckerberg, Altman) amass enough power to drive global events and shape the world aligned to their vision. 

Scenario 5: Tipping point: Energy demands for AI and robotics pushed the world past a climate tipping point.
